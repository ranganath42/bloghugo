# If exclude is non-empty, and a local or remote file's path matches it, that file is not synced.
# If include is non-empty, and a local or remote file's path does not match it, that file is not synced.
# As a result, local files that don't pass the include/exclude filters are not uploaded to remote,
# and remote files that don't pass the include/exclude filters are not deleted.
# include = "**.html" # would only include files with ".html" suffix
# exclude = "**.{jpg, png}" # would exclude files with ".jpg" or ".png" suffix
