My name is Ranganath. 
  
I like writing code, which works out well because that's what I do for a living.

I started my career developing embedded solutions for multi-function printers. I also developed IoT solutions for smart meters where I discovered the weirdly fun low-power network communication. Developing solutions for these power and resource constrained devices instilled in me an appreciation of writing efficient code.

In between, I worked in FinTech, where I worked with a talented bunch developing electronic trading platforms. They (the systems, not the people) are big, distributed, and operate with high-volume at low-latency and introduced me to a whole lot of very different, but equally interesting challenges.

All these different experiences have taught me valuable lessons. And in my current work at PaperCut, I often go back to those lessons whether I’m working with OS-level print spooler internals or developing backend servers.

Technologies change, but the one thing that didn’t change was how awesome the teams I got to work with. I immensely enjoy working with people, whether it’s as a leader or as an individual contributor. Over the last 15 years, across three countries, I got to work with, and most importantly learn from the best.

I have been mainly working with C and C++. Over the last couple of years, I have also been using [Golang](https://golang.org/) quite a lot.
